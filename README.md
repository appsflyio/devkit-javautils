##appsfly.io Dev Kit Java Utils

# About Java Utils
Java Utils contains resources to help communicate with appsfly.io secure server through encryption. 

##  Get Started
To start posting messages securely we need the following:

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Module Handle | Unique handle of the micro module. This will be provided by the service provider. |
| Secret Key | Secret Key is required for encryption. Secret Key should be generated on the Appsfly publisher dashboard. |
| App Key | Application key to identify the publisher instance. |

## Generation of checksum
String payload = body + "|" +  microModuleId + "|" + config.appKey + "|" + userID;
String checksum = CtyptoUtil.getInstance().getChecksum(payload.getBytes(), config.secretKey);

## Verification of checkSum

        AppInstance.AFConfig config = new AppInstance.AFConfig("https://microapps.appsfly.io", "1234567890123456", "92ae2562-aebc-468f-bc9e-aa3cdd9d39b1");
